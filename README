This is a collection of Ansible playbooks for Debian 12 machines.

- Enable automatic package updates (unattended-upgrades):

  $ ansible-playbook playbooks/unattended-upgrades.yml -K

- Configure OpenSSH daemon:

  $ ansible-playbook playbooks/openssh-daemon.yml -K

  This playbook hardens the OpenSSH daemon by removing certain Diffie-Hellman
  moduli, re-generating an EdDSA host key and configuring sshd to only accept
  public key authentication for certain non-root users. Additionally, only
  select modern and secure key exchange algorithms & ciphers are accepted.
  Use with caution!
